# Python-TextBasedGame
This is my school project for a text based game where you collect items and move between rooms to defeat a villain

# Summarize the project
This project was done by me as the final project for a class Intro to Scripting. It is a text based game that is happening in a house and a fugitive is hiding in one of the rooms. Your main goal is to gather all the neccessary items to be able to defeat the fugitive. If you find him before you gather the items you will loose the game. This code implements dictionary with some function definitions and while loop with multiple other loops inside of it to make the mechanics of the game work smoothly.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think the while loop where the game is happening. It took me a while to be able to make all the for and if loops work and I was very happy when the code finally worked as intended. Also the troubleshooting and repairing the buggs took me a moment and I am proud of myself that I was able to do some changes, so that the code worked as intended. I did not have problems with syntax and the code was running but had problems such as the inventory did not show the item after picking up or after picking up the item it still showed in the room and asked if I want to pick it up again...

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, safe, etc?
Since this was my first ever class on coding in Python, there is definitely room for improvements. The material we covered is considered basic and begginer Python. I am interested in learning more Python so I would be able to improve the code and include more complex functions or classes to make the game even more interesting or challenging. The place I think I could improve more would be all the loops inside the while ("gaming") loop. I feel like there is a way how to make it look better and run smoothly.

# Did you find writing any place of this code challenging and how did you overcome this? 
As I mentioned above the most challenging thing was troubleshooting and searching for buggs in the while loop. It took me few hours to make it work and sometimes after repairing one bugg other started to act up. I overcame this with patience and careful lookig through the code sometimes I had to add something, delete something or just slightly chamge the code. Also, stepping aside and getting some mental rest was crucial, especially when I started to be frustrated.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The troubleshooting and searching for buggs is definitely a great skill I've learned during working on this project. Another great skill is working with loops and making them work as intended. Utilizing defined functions and dictionary are another great skills in the beggining of Python coding.
